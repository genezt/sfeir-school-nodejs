# Classes : Exercice

Create a **Cat** class with a constructor taking a **name** as a parameter. It needs a **meow** method (with a console.log of your choice) and a **play** method (with a console.log of your choice).

Create a **MainCoon** class that extends the **Cat** class with a constructor taking a **name** and a **color**. Override the play method and call the parent's **play** (with a console.log of your choice). Add a **sleep** method (with a console.log of your choice).

Test your code by opening a nodejs console. Import your code into the console (easy if you have followed everything ;) ) then build your objects.
