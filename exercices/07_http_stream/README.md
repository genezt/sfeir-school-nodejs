Follow to server HTTP

---

## Exercice 4

Create a `run-04.js` file to return [le logo google](https://www.google.fr/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png) in response to a `GET` request on `/google`

## Tips:

- `http` also exposes methods for issuing requests. The API differs greatly from that present in the browsers.
- `streams` are node objects that can be easily chained, a proxy written in node is very simple!
- 
## test

launch test with

```
npm test -- 07_http_stream/test.spec.js
```
