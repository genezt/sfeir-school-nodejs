# Sfeir Schools

We are going to do a little project to manage Sfeir Schools!

We will need [Node.js 16](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Step 1

- Install [Express](http://expressjs.com/).
- Create a route for method [à la méthode `GET`](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#M%C3%A9thodes) need to answer "Hello, Sfeir School!".
- Launch with `npm start`.
- Create a script `dev` in  package.json to launch using `nodemon`.
- Test with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): `http http://localhost:3000/` or with [httpie](https://httpie.org/).

For the users of Postman, you can import the request collection [Sfeir school NodeJS.postman_collection.json](../../resources/Sfeir school NodeJS.postman_collection.json)
