## Lab

In exercices/javascript/promises

In the **exercise1Fn** function, complete the creation of the promise in order to
**solve** it with the value "I love promise" after 500ms. (Use setTimeout).
Attach to this promise a then in order to **console.log** the value received. Return the resulting Promise.

In the **exercise2Fn** function, complete the creation of the promise in order to
the **reject** with the value "I hate rejection" after 500ms. (Use setTimeout).
Attach to this promise a catch in order to **console.log** the value received. Return the resulting Promise.

In the **exercise3Fn** function, make a chain of promises starting from
the **exercise3** object to add 5 to the value, multiply it by 2 and finally subtract 4.
Each of these operations must be performed **in a different piece of the chain**. Return the resulting Promise.
